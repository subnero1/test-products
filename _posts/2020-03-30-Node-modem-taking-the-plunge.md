Our [Silver edition](https://subnero.com/products/silver.html#title) (Node Configuration) modem is taking the plunge in the Mediterranean Sea.

The team of [Dr Roee Diamant](https://sites.google.com/edu.haifa.ac.il/anl/personnel){:target="_blank"}, at The University of Haifa, deployed a Node configuration Subnero modem with an additional [co-processor](https://subnero.com/wnc/2018/11/17/Underwater-modem-with-a-coprocessor.html), that is configured with sonar-like functionalities, for their research.
